## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This challenge allow me to cement my knowlege of using toggle to add and remove a class on an element while clicking on the share button.

### Continued development

Although I did not use it in this project, I would like work with media queries in JavaScript using matchMedia() on similar projects in the future.

I would also like to learn how to style svgs in css more effectively, instead of using Font Awesome Icons.

### Useful resources

- [Florin Pop YouTube video](https://www.example.com) - This Florin Pop Responsive Navigation YouTube tutorial help me get to grips with using JavaScript Toggle to add and remove a class on an element.
